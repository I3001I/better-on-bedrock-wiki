## Changelog

### Changes

- Updated Waystones
  - Added a toggle for players to choose whether a Waystone is global or not
  - When global is enabled, all players in the world will have access that Waystone and they will be able to teleport to that Waystone
  - If any player breaks a Waystone, that Waystone will be removed globally. This prevents a few bugs.
- Slightly increased the spawn rate of the Flender Tower
- Reduced the spawn rate of Fire Wisps
- Updated textures for Hellhoun, Shielded Pyroclast and Seeker
- Added trade tables for the Ore Smelter enchantment, aquired by Librarian Villagers
- Made Structure more rare

### Fixes

- Fixed a bug where the Poggy boss was stuck within a state
- Fixed a bug that allowed players to kill Poggy in early phases
- Fixed the problem that allowed swords to break blocks in creative mode
- Fixed the issue where the Amethyst Axe could not be used on the Miner Bench
- Fixed the missing dependancy error
