# Better on Bedrock
## Beginners Guide
This guide will only point out how to install the Add-On, what the configs do, and a basica idea of what you can expect.

## Set Up
### Downloading
You either downloaded the Add-On from MCPEDL or Modbay.

### Importing
Once you have downloaded the Add-On, the file will end with `.zip`. Simply rename the file and replace `.zip` with `.mcaddon`. Once done, you can open the `mcaddon` with Minecraft.

::: warning
Android 12+ will not recognize Minecraft for `.mcaddon` files. Download Third-Party file explorers like ZArchiver.

### Adding to your world
Create a new world. Configure the world how you like, and enable EVERY experimental toggle. Add the resource pack and behavior pack to your world and load your world.

## Add-On config
### What it does
You will notice that you have items in your inventory.

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <img src="./assets/hotbar.png" alt="Example Image">
</div>

Do not fear, these items are there to help you. The `Config` item is where you can toggle various options.
- Player Corpse
    * Enables Player Corpse
- Poggy's WAWLA
    * Enables Poggy's WAWLA UI
- Starter Items
    * Gives you started tools. Can only be used once.

## What to do now
Once you're set, you can enjoy the Add-On. You can toggle the options via the `Config` item at any time.

## A Tip
As a new player, you should use the Quest Scroll to learn anything about the Add-On. If you're stuck on what something does, refer to this wiki.
